pcap_loop() 

is similar to pcap_dispatch() except it keeps reading packets until cnt packets are processed or an error occurs. 
It does not return when live read timeouts occur. Rather, specifying a non-zero read timeout to pcap_open_live() and then calling pcap_dispatch() 
allows the reception and processing of any packets that arrive when the timeout occurs. A negative cnt causes pcap_loop() to loop forever
(or at least until an error occurs).
